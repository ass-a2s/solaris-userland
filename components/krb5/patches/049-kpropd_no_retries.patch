#
# Disable retrying in kpropd, when kadm5 interface cannot be initialized.
#
# When MIT kpropd cannot contact master KDC, it keeps retrying indefinitely.
# This doesn't play well with SMF; krb5_prop service is reported as online,
# while the daemon really just keeps failing to connect.
#
# This patch changes kpropd, so that it exits with error immediately.
#
# This is a Solaris specific change, it will not be contributed upstream.
# Patch source: in-house
