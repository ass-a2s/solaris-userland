 DESCRIPTION

 This file contains a straightforward implementation of a fixed-sized
 hash table using self-organizing linked lists [Knuth73, pp. 398-399] for
 collision resolution.  There are two potentially interesting things
 about this implementation:

 1) The table is power-of-two sized.  Prime sized tables are more
 traditional, but do not have a significant advantage over power-of-two
 sized table, especially when double hashing is not used for collision
 resolution.

 2) The hash computation uses a table of random integers [Hanson97,
 pp. 39-41].

 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

 With a table size of 512, the current implementation is sufficient for a
 few hundred keys.  Since this is well above the expected size of the
 tables for which this implementation was designed, the implementation of
 dynamic hash tables was postponed until the need arises.  A common (and
 naive) approach to dynamic hash table implementation simply creates a
 new hash table when necessary, rehashes all the data into the new table,
 and destroys the old table.  The approach in [Larson88] is superior in
 two ways: 1) only a portion of the table is expanded when needed,
 distributing the expansion cost over several insertions, and 2) portions
 of the table can be locked, enabling a scalable thread-safe
 implementation.

 DESCRIPTION

 This file contains a simple, straightforward implementation of the Park
 & Miller "Minimal Standard" PRNG [PM88, PMS93], which is a Lehmer
 multiplicative linear congruential generator (MLCG) with a period of
 2^31-1.

 This implementation is intended to provide a reliable, portable PRNG
 that is suitable for testing a hash table implementation and for
 implementing skip lists.

 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

 If initial seeds are not selected randomly, two instances of the PRNG
 can be correlated.  [Knuth81, pp. 32-33] describes a shuffling technique
 that can eliminate this problem.

 If PRNGs are used for simulation, the period of the current
 implementation may be too short.  [LE88] discusses methods of combining
 MLCGs to produce much longer periods, and suggests some alternative
 values for A and M.  [LE90 and Sch92] also provide information on
 long-period PRNGs.

 DESCRIPTION

 This file contains a straightforward implementation of a fixed-sized
 hash table using self-organizing linked lists [Knuth73, pp. 398-399] for
 collision resolution.  There are two potentially interesting things
 about this implementation:

 1) The table is power-of-two sized.  Prime sized tables are more
 traditional, but do not have a significant advantage over power-of-two
 sized table, especially when double hashing is not used for collision
 resolution.

 2) The hash computation uses a table of random integers [Hanson97,
 pp. 39-41].

 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

 With a table size of 512, the current implementation is sufficient for a
 few hundred keys.  Since this is well above the expected size of the
 tables for which this implementation was designed, the implementation of
 dynamic hash tables was postponed until the need arises.  A common (and
 naive) approach to dynamic hash table implementation simply creates a
 new hash table when necessary, rehashes all the data into the new table,
 and destroys the old table.  The approach in [Larson88] is superior in
 two ways: 1) only a portion of the table is expanded when needed,
 distributing the expansion cost over several insertions, and 2) portions
 of the table can be locked, enabling a scalable thread-safe
 implementation.

 DESCRIPTION

 This file contains a simple, straightforward implementation of the Park
 & Miller "Minimal Standard" PRNG [PM88, PMS93], which is a Lehmer
 multiplicative linear congruential generator (MLCG) with a period of
 2^31-1.

 This implementation is intended to provide a reliable, portable PRNG
 that is suitable for testing a hash table implementation and for
 implementing skip lists.

 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

 If initial seeds are not selected randomly, two instances of the PRNG
 can be correlated.  [Knuth81, pp. 32-33] describes a shuffling technique
 that can eliminate this problem.

 If PRNGs are used for simulation, the period of the current
 implementation may be too short.  [LE88] discusses methods of combining
 MLCGs to produce much longer periods, and suggests some alternative
 values for A and M.  [LE90 and Sch92] also provide information on
 long-period PRNGs.
