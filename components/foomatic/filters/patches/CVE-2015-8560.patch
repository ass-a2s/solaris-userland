Note that the back tick was added to escape characters in the patch CVE-2015-8327,
which is applied before this patch that adds semicolon.

Upstream status:
cups-filters is ancestor of the foomatic-filters for cups in cases discussed in Bug 22546287
...so community (Till) will backport this fix by own into foomatic-filters if found it usefull.
