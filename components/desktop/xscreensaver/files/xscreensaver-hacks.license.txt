flyingtoasters:

 Draws 3D flying toasters, and toast.  Inspired by the ancient
 Berkeley Systems / After Dark hack, but now updated to the wide
 wonderful workd of OpenGL and 3D!

 Code by jwz; object models by Baconmonkey.

 The original After Dark flying toasters, with the fluffy white wings,
 were a trademark of Berkeley Systems.  Berkeley Systems ceased to exist
 some time in 1998, having been gobbled up by Sierra Online, who were
 subsequently gobbled up by Flipside and/or Vivendi (it's hard to tell
 exactly what happened when.)

 I doubt anyone even cares any more, but if they do, hopefully this homage,
 with the space-age 3D jet-plane toasters, will be considered different
 enough that whoever still owns the trademark to the fluffy-winged 2D
 bitmapped toasters won't get all huffy at us.
