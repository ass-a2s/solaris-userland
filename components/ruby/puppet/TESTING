A STC suite with persistent errors exists but is not used on a regular basis.

Generic testing uses pre-built rspec tests with CI (travis-CI, AppVeyor)
based on github integration where coverage has been extended post modification.

While spec files can be installed by setting the facet.optional.test=true
tests cannot be run on Solaris without modifications to the environment
providing the required ruby gems.

See Puppet Documentation for an overview of testing with rspec
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/docs/rspec_tutorial.md

Core puppet type and provider testing is performed by Puppet for a range of
operating systems including Solaris 10 and 11.

Adhoc individual module testing may be performed by reviewing the Setup and
Usage portions of the README.md shipped with each module.

e.g. Testing install behavior with mysql
puppet apply -e "include '::mysql::server'"


-- Manual testing guidelines
----------------------------

-- For detailed info about working with Puppet On Solaris, please
-- refer to

-- Setting up Puppet Master and agent(s).
-- Consider hosts
    - puppet-master
    - puppet-agent

-- Install the Puppet IPS package
--    pkg:/system/management/puppet
-- on both the master and all nodes that will act as Puppet agent.


-- setting up master

- set config parameters for puppet:master
# svccfg -s puppet:master setprop config/server= host: <hostname-master>
# svccfg -s puppet:master setprop config/bindaddressr= astring: 0.0.0.0

# svcadm enable puppet:master
# svcs puppet:master


-- setting up agent

- set config parameters for puppet:agent (on all agent nodes)

# svccfg -s puppet:agent setprop config/server= host: <hostname-master>
# svccfg -s puppet:agent refresh

NOTE : DO not enable this service yet!

# puppet agent --test
(this will creates a new SSL key and sets up a auth request to master)

- On master node
# puppet cert list
# puppet cert sign <hostname-agent>

- On agent node (again)
# puppet agent --test
# svcadm enable puppet:agent
# svcs puppet:agent

-- testing master-client setup; using 'file' resource type create
-- a custom file on agent via configuration applied by master 

- on master 
# cat /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp 
$file_contents = $osfamily ? {
  'solaris' => "Hello Oracle Solaris",
  'redhat' => "Hello RHEL",
}

file { '/var/tmp/custom-file.txt':
  ensure => 'present',
  content => $file_contents,
}


- on client
# ls -l /var/tmp/custom-file.txt
/var/tmp/custom-file.txt: No such file or directory

# puppet agent --test
