# DBD::Sqlite ships custom sqlite3 sources. We remove the sources to make sure
# that we do not build/link against it. However just removing the files would
# break the build process. The next best thing is to make the files empty. The
# macro $(RM) is intentionaly not used here, as it contains '-f' parameter.
# Using plain 'rm' makes the action fail if the files are not found.
